Sensitive Image Recognition (provided with DLP Core) detects text embedded in images such as scanned forms, documents, screenshots, pictures and PDFs by leveraging our proprietary Form Recognition technology and built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. • Vector Machine Learning protects intellectual property with nuanced characteristics that are rare or difficult to describe such as financial reports and source code. Unlike other detection technologies, Vector Machine Learning does not require you to locate, describe, or fingerprint the data you need to protect. Symantec DLP includes Structured Data Matching detection (to find sensitive data in tabular format). It also offers a rich set of out-of-the-box and add-on APIs to allow you to customize and integrate with a wide range of third-party security products, cloud, and proprietary applications: DLP REST API, DLP FlexResponse API, DLP Content Extraction API, DLP Incident Reporting and Update API, and DLP API Detection Virtual Appliance. Extend Data Protection Beyond DLP As sensitive data is shared with external users or travels to the cloud and goes outside of your managed environment, it becomes vulnerable to unwanted exposure. Our solution provides comprehensive protection for your data throughout its lifecycle beyond your managed premises, with policy driven cloud access security, classification, encryption, user analytics, and web gateways. • Extend DLP policies to cloud applications: Extend DLP detection, policies, and workflows to cloud apps through integration with Symantec CloudSOC (CASB), and manage incidents on a single console. • Simplify incident triage and policy management: Reduce time and efforts for incident remediation and policy management, and mitigate data risk with Symantec Information Centric Analytics (ICA), a User and Entity Behavior Analytics provided with DLP Core. • Share data more securely with others: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data via strong authentication when data is shared with business partners with Symantec VIP Identity and Access Management. • Prevent data from going to unwanted sites: Ensure sensitive data doesn’t get leaked over untrusted web traffic, even encrypted traffic, by leveraging DLP integration with Symantec Secure Web Gateways: Symantec ProxySG and Web Security Service. • Integrated with Microsoft Information Protection (MIP): Symantec DLP is integrated with the broad classification and encryption capabilities provided by MIP. This solution gives customers the ability to detect and read documents and emails protected using MIP. System Requirements The Symantec DLP solution comprises a single unified management platform, lightweight endpoint agent, and powerful content-aware detection products. We offer the most deployment flexibility with a wide range of options for any type of environment: on-premises software; virtual and physical appliances; public, private, and hybrid cloud services; and managed services delivered by Symantec Partners. Unlike other solutions, Symantec DLP is proven to work in highly distributed environments and scale up to hundreds of thousands of users.
